    Thank you for participating in our study! Our goal in this study is to <strong> better understand how you experience emotions in your everyday life.</strong> First, we would like you to carefully read some background information about emotion. We would then like you to reflect on your experiences of 8 emotions and to use an interactive tool we developed to tell us about your experiences and answer a few questions. Finally, we would like you to use the same interactive tool one more time to tell us about your experiences of 12 emotions. The entire study should take approximately 20 minutes to complete. We hope you enjoy participating in our study!
