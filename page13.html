    <strong> Drawing on your own personal experience, please arrange the emotions in the field below according to how CONTROLLABLE they typically are when you experience them. Place emotions that are uncontrollable most of the time you experience them closer to the LEFT-HAND SIDE of the screen. Place emotions that are controllable most of the time you experience them closer to the RIGHT-HAND SIDE of the screen.</strong>
    <br><br>
    Remember, an emotion is controllable when one can change its intensity and/or duration at will
    <br><br>
    Please note:
    <br><br>
    * The closer you place two emotions along the <em>horizontal</em> axis, the more similar you indicate them to be in terms of how controllable/uncontrollable they typically are when you experience them.
    <br><br>
    * You can place the emotions anywhere along the <em>vertical</em> axis.
    <br><br>
    * You can place two or more emotions directly above/below each other to indicate that you view them as equally controllable/uncontrollable.
    <br><br>
    * It is not required that you cover the entire area evenly. For example, if, in your experience, none of the emotions below are uncontrollable most of the time you experience them, simply leave the bottom part of the area empty.
    <br><br>
    * There are no right or wrong answers. Please draw on your personal experience to complete this task.
