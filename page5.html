    2. Sometimes, our emotions are PLEASANT. Other times, our emotions can be relatively UNPLEASANT. <strong> An emotion is pleasant when it feels good to experience it in the moment. An emotion is unpleasant when it feels bad to experience it in the moment. </strong> Some emotions that feel good in the moment may have unpleasant consequences in the future. Similarly, some emotions that do not feel good in the moment may lead to pleasant outcomes in the future. When considering the extent to which an emotion tends to be pleasant or unpleasant, we would like you to consider only how pleasant or unpleasant it feels to experience it in the moment, with no regard for future consequences.
